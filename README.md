## Installation

### Option 1 — Inno Setup Wizard (recommended for most users)

Download **`ValoTracker-Setup-x.x.x.exe`** from the
[latest release](https://github.com/Londopy/ValoTracker/releases/latest) and run it.
The wizard installs the TUI, GUI, or both — with optional desktop and Start Menu shortcuts.

### Option 2 — MSI Installer (enterprise / silent install)

Download **`ValoTracker-x.x.x-x86_64.msi`** from the
[latest release](https://github.com/Londopy/ValoTracker/releases/latest).

- Per-user install, **no UAC prompt required**
- Supports silent deployment: `msiexec /i ValoTracker.msi /qn`

### Option 3 — Portable Binaries

Grab a standalone `.exe` directly from the
[latest release](https://github.com/Londopy/ValoTracker/releases/latest) — no install needed, just drop it anywhere on your `PATH`.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ValoTracker.exe` | Terminal UI |
| `ValoTracker-gui.exe` | Desktop GUI |

### Option 4 — Scoop

```powershell
scoop bucket add valotracker https://github.com/Londopy/ValoTracker
scoop install valotracker
```

Scoop handles updates automatically (`scoop update valotracker`).

### Option 5 — pip (Python)

```bash
pip install valotracker
valotracker        # TUI
valotracker-gui    # GUI
```

The wheel bundles pre-compiled Windows binaries — no Rust toolchain required.

### Option 6 — Build from Source

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Londopy/ValoTracker.git
cd ValoTracker

# TUI
cargo build --release -p valotracker-tui
# → target\release\ValoTracker.exe

# GUI
cargo build --release -p valotracker-gui --features gui
# → target\release\ValoTracker-gui.exe

# MSI (requires cargo-wix and WiX Toolset v3)
cargo install cargo-wix
cargo wix -p valotracker-installer --no-build --nocapture
```

**Requirements:** Rust 1.78+, Windows 10/11, VALORANT installed.

## Python Bindings

```bash
pip install valotracker
```

```python
import valotracker

client = valotracker.ValoTrackerClient()
client.wait_for_match()          # blocks until a match is detected

for p in client.get_players():
    print(f"{p.name}#{p.tag}  {p.rank_name} {p.rr}RR  HS:{p.headshot_pct:.0%}")
```

---

## Configuration

Config is stored at `%APPDATA%\ValoTracker\config.toml` and created automatically on first run.

```toml
[display]
show_streamer_tag       = true
show_party_size         = true
highlight_enemy_parties = true
short_ranks             = false
show_level              = true
show_kd                 = true
show_hs                 = true
show_wr                 = true
show_rr_delta           = true

[features]
minimize_to_tray   = false   # GUI: minimize to tray on close instead of quitting
run_on_startup     = false   # Add ValoTracker to Windows startup (hidden in tray)
check_updates      = true    # Silent background update check (once per 24 h)
notifications      = true    # Windows desktop toast notifications
discord_rpc        = false   # Discord Rich Presence
discord_app_id     = ""      # Leave blank to use the bundled app ID
```

Press `[c]` in the TUI to edit display settings live without touching the file.
